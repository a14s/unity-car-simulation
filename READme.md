# Autonomous Car Software and Simulation
### The goal of this project was to implement Perception, Localization, Mapping, and Control software for an Autonomous Car in a simulation environment. The simulation environment was made on Unity and connected to Python through ROS to send data and receive commands.
### A monocular camera based mapping approach was developed while perceiving lane lines and lanes to plan paths around them.
